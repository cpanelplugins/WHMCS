# WHMCS provides the most seamless experience for cPanel users
Integrating cPanel & WHM with WHMCS lets you harness all the power of this robust control panel. You'll have a seamless experience using WHMCS's billing and support features alongside a comprehensive control panel. While working with both dedicated and VPS servers, you will have management tools for both reseller and shared hosting. With our integration, you can sync accounts and domains between cPanel and WHMCS instantly. WHMCS Connect and cPanel Single Sign-On will let you access everything you need.

Your customers will be able to log in to cPanel using their WHMCS credentials as well as initiate automated password resets. In the Client Area, direct linking will give them access to many of cPanel's most-used features. They'll also be able to create email addresses from within WHMCS. In cPanel, your customers will be able to access WHMCS billing and support resources with just a click. It's a feature-rich integration that no other billing system can match.

For no-sweat maximization of your revenue, you'll be able to automate package upgrades and downgrades. Features like auto-installation of SSL accounts and auto-configuration of MX records for external email services will help you manage your customers' needs. When it's time for invoicing, it's easy to bill your customers for their resource consumption and feature use. Disk usage and bandwidth usage reporting will make sure you have the full picture on what your business needs.
